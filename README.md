# What

This is the code behind my code pen [here](https://codepen.io/sd3x/full/OJJXdBZ).

This is fork of another version of [Whack-a-mole](https://codepen.io/alvaromontoro/pen/MWWKKMN).

# Why

I thought the original CodePen was very clever, but when I looked at the source


# How

This repo is intended as a historical archive of the changes for my "Extended Whack-a-mole".  The first commit
is the original version.  Followed by commits for various features.  I felt the steps were worth tracking.

Someday I will split them out to branches, maybe.
